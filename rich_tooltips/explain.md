This directory contains the core code for the `django-rich-tooltips` Django application.

## Contents:

*   **`__init__.py`**: Marks this directory as a Python package.

*   **`apps.py`**: Defines the application configuration class (`RichTooltipsConfig`).
*   **`models.py`**: Defines the Django models used by the application. Currently, it includes `TooltipTestModel` used for demonstration and testing purposes within the `test_project`.
*   **`tests.py`**: Contains unit tests for the application's backend logic (though currently minimal).
*   **`urls.py`**: Defines URL patterns specific to this application (currently empty as the plugin primarily integrates via `admin.py`).
*   **`views.py`**: Contains view functions or classes for the application (currently empty).
*   **`migrations/`**: Contains database migration files generated by `makemigrations` to manage changes to the application's models.

    *   **`rich_tooltips/css/rich_tooltips.css`**: Stylesheet defining the appearance of the tooltips, including theme support and the timer animation.
    *   **`rich_tooltips/js/rich_tooltips.js`**: JavaScript code responsible for finding elements with `data-tooltip-*` attributes, fetching/rendering content (HTML or Markdown via `marked.js`), handling hover events, managing the fix timer, and applying theme classes.
*   **`templates/`**: Contains Django templates provided by the plugin.
    *   **`admin/base_site.html`**: An overridden version of the admin's base template that includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for the plugin to function.
*   **`explain.md`**: This file, explaining the contents of the `rich_tooltips` directory.
